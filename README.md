### Hello! :)
This dictionary is dedicated to recording fandom terms and vocabulary.
Any definitions have been created by me, compiled from fandom members, or taken from official dictionaries.
Entries are marked with appropriate markers indicating additional information about the entry (such as "disputed definition" or "coined term").
If you'd like to submit an entry to be added to the dictionary, email the term, definition, and examples of its usage (with links if possible) to redsfandomdictionary@gmail.com. By emailing me, you are relenqushing your copyright over the contents of your email and allowing me to use your words in a public domain work.
